            <p>
                When I was young, I started to develop an interest to using computers. My curiousity and over-zealous attitude paved the way for me to
                stumble upon the world wide web which led me to explore its massive space. I continued it everyday and I was able to learn and experience
                a whole lot of things.

                As I grew older and wiser, I wanted to know how the games that I had been playing and all the websites
                that I had visited and used for years were created. Eventually, I discovered how they were made and what they used to make them and
                I was fascinated by it.
            </p>
            <p>I am so passionate about it and I wanted to learn more so I decided to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems.</p>
